### Prerequisites

A Data Product should already exist in order to attach the new components to it. You probably also want some kind of Storage Area available to read from/write to.

### Component basic Information

This section includes the basic information that any Component of must have:

- Name: Required. The name of the component.
- Fully Qualified Name: Fully qualified name of the component.
- Description: Required. Help others understand what this component is for. What data will it store?
- Domain: Required. Domain of the Data Product this component belongs to. Be sure to choose it correctly as otherwise you won't find your Data Product below.
- Data Product: Required. Data Product this component belongs to. Be sure to choose the right one as it cannot be changed.
- Identifier: Autogenerated from the information above. A unique identifier for the component. It will not be editable after creation and is a string composed of [a-zA-Z] separated by any of [-_].
- Development Group: Automatically selected from the Data Product metadata. Data Product development group.
- Dependencies: A component could depend on other components in the same Data Product. This information will be used to deploy the components in such an order that their dependencies already exist.
- Tags: Tags for the component.

| **Secrets**               | secretProvider: AWS<br/>region: EU_WEST_1<br/>secretId: airflow/connections/snowflake |

After this the system will show you the summary of the template, and you can go back and edit or go ahead and create the Component. With the examples values given here it should look something like this:

After clicking on "Create" the registering of the Component will start. If no errors occurred it will go through the 3 phases (Fetching, Publishing and Registering) and will give you the links to the newly created Repository and the component in the Catalog.

The new repository will contain a standard skeleton of a dbt project as generated by `dbt init` with the small exception that all the files except the `dbt-project.yml` will be contained in a sub-folder:

```
skeleton
├─ dbt_project.yml
├─ catalog-info.yml
├─ dbt/
│  ├─ analyses/
│  ├─ macros/
│  ├─ models/
│  ├─ seeds/
│  ├─ snapshots/
│  ├─ tests/
```

Now you can clone the newly created repository and work on the dbt project inside the dbt/ folder.

**Be careful not to delete or modify the `catalog-info.yml` as well as keep the project structure as given.**
