Designed by [Agile Lab](https://www.agilelab.it/), witboost is a versatile platform that addresses a wide range of sophisticated data engineering challenges. It enables businesses to discover, enhance, and productize their data, fostering the creation of automated data platforms that adhere to the highest standards of data governance. Want to know more about witboost? Check it out [here](https://www.agilelab.it/witboost) or [contact us!](https://www.agilelab.it/contacts)

This repository is part of our [Starter Kit](https://github.com/agile-lab-dev/witboost-starter-kit) meant to showcase witboost's integration capabilities and provide a "batteries-included" product.

# DBT Workload Template

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Usage](#usage)

## Overview

Use this template to automatically create a Workload based on a dbt project that can be referenced from other components inside the platform.

This component does not provision any resources or infrastructure, and as such can ba used without any Specific Provisioner.

### What's a Template?

A Template is a tool that helps create components inside a Data Mesh. Templates help establish a standard across the organization. This standard leads to easier understanding, management and maintenance of components. Templates provide a predefined structure so that developers don't have to start from scratch each time, which leads to faster development and allows them to focus on other aspects, such as testing and business logic.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.agilelab.it/docs/p1_user/p6_advanced/p6_1_templates/#getting-started).

### What's a Workload?

Workload refers to any data processing step (etl, job, transformation etc) that is applied to data in a Data Product. Workloads can pull data from sources external to the Data Mesh or from an Output Port of a different Data Product or from Storage Areas inside the same Data Product, and persist it for further processing or serving.

### DBT

dbt (Data Build Tool) is a transformation tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform, test, and document their data inside their data warehouse more effectively. It allows you to write transformations as SQL code, maintaining the logic in a version-controlled environment. With dbt, you can build transformation pipelines that consist of simple SELECT statements and views, creating a chain of transformations that shape your raw data into a useful form for analysis. Besides, dbt also supports data testing, ensuring the validity and quality of the transformed data, and it can automatically generate documentation, making it easier for teams to understand their datasets.

Learn more about it on the [official website](https://www.getdbt.com/).

## Usage

### Prerequisites

A Data Product should already exist in order to attach the new components to it. You probably also want some kind of Storage Area available to read from/write to.

### Component basic information

This section includes the basic information that any component of must have

- Name: Required name used for display purposes on your Data Product
- Fully Qualified Name: Workload fully qualified name, this is optional as will be generated by the system if not given by you
- Description: A short description to help others understand what this Workload is for.
- Domain: The Domain of the Data Product this Workload belongs to. Be sure to choose it correctly as is a fundamental part of the Workload and cannot be changed afterwards.
- Data Product: The Data Product this Workload belongs to, be sure to choose the right one.
- Identifier: Unique ID for this new entity inside the domain. Don't worry to fill this field, it will be automatically filled for you.
- Development Group: Development group of this Data Product. Don't worry to fill this field, it will be automatically filled for you.
- Depends On: If you want your workload to depend on other components from the Data Product, you can choose this option (Optional).

*Example:*

| Field name              | Example value                                                                                          |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**                | Vaccinations DBT Workload                                                                              |
| **Description**         | Creates a DBT project to clean vaccinations table                                                      |
| **Domain**              | domain:healthcare                                                                                      |
| **Data Product**        | system:healthcare.vaccinationsdp.0                                                                     |
| ***Identifier***        | Will look something like this: *healthcare.vaccinationsdp.0.vaccinations-dbt-workload*                 |
| ***Development Group*** | Might look something like this: *group:datameshplatform* Depends on the Data Product development group |

### DBT Project Details

- **Project name:** Give a name to the dbt project, by default the name "dmb_dbt_transform" will be chosen.

*Example:*

| Field name       | Example value              |
|:-----------------|:---------------------------|
| **Project name** | vaccinations_dbt_transform |


After this the system will show you the summary of the template, and you can go back and edit or go ahead and create the Component. With the examples values given here it should look something like this:

After clicking on "Create" the registering of the Component will start. If no errors occurred it will go through the 3 phases (Fetching, Publishing and Registering) and will give you the links to the newly created Repository and the component in the Catalog.

The new repository will contain a standard skeleton of a dbt project as generated by `dbt init` with the small exception that all the files except the `dbt-project.yml` will be contained in a subfolder:

```
skeleton
├─ dbt_project.yml
├─ catalog-info.yml
├─ dbt/
│  ├─ analyses/
│  ├─ macros/
│  ├─ models/
│  ├─ seeds/
│  ├─ snapshots/
│  ├─ tests/
```

Now you can clone the newly created repository and work on the dbt project inside the dbt/ folder.

**Be careful not to delete or modify the `catalog-info.yml` as well as keep the project structure as given.**
